# My Sports Handbook
API Hack  - Pull NFL team information for a selected Team

## Overview
www.thesportsdb.com contains information for many different types of leagues.  Within a league there is 
information for: 
1. each team within the league and specific information for the team
2. events for the team, past and future, with results
3. roster for each team
4. information about each team's player

using the developer's API key, the data is incomplete but a good sample for development.  In particular for
this API Hack, the National Football League (NFL) was chosen since its season was in progress during 
development.
